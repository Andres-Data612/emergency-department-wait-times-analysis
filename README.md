## Emergency Department Wait Times Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes weekly Emergency Department (A&E) wait-time performance using public NHS Scotland data.

The objective was to evaluate performance against national wait-time standards while assessing how patient volume influences operational outcomes across treatment locations.

This project demonstrates data cleaning, analytical reasoning, KPI design, and interactive dashboard development.

🛠 Tools Used

-MySQL – Data cleaning, validation, and transformation

-SQL – Date conversion, null checks, duplicate detection, and integrity validation

-Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design

-DAX – Creation of weighted performance KPIs

📊 Dashboard Features

-Executive KPI overview page

-Weighted wait-time performance metrics (4, 8, and 12-hour thresholds)

-Attendance trend analysis (yearly & monthly)

-Location-level performance comparisons

-Drillthrough pages for detailed site-level insights

-Custom tooltip pages

-Bookmark-based view switching for interactive exploration

📐 Analytical Approach

Performance percentages were weighted by total attendances to ensure metrics accurately reflect true patient experience and operational load.

This avoids misleading conclusions that can occur when using simple averages across sites with vastly different patient volumes.

💡 Key Insight

Weighted wait-time metrics provide a more accurate and operationally meaningful representation of Emergency Department performance, particularly during high-volume periods.
